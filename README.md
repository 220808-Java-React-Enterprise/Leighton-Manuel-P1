# L & M APIs: Reimbursary

## Description

Providing employees with a system to request reimbursements for business-related expenses they incur during the year is necessary for creating a healthy, positive workplace culture. However, handling sensitive information and maintaining trust between employees at all levels can be challenging and requires the right software.<br>
<br>
That's why we at L & M APIs have come together to bring you Reimbursary, a back-end API specifically designed to manage your transactions seemlessly and effortlessly. Integrate Reimbursary into your employee portal and your employees will have no trouble submitting, monitoring, and managing their reimbursement requests, ensuring that their purchases will be covered and keeping your workplace friendly and upbeat.

### Usage

Reimbursary utilizes HTTP requests for its functionality. It is structured for use with three classes of users: standard employees who make reimbursement requests, finance managers who approve or deny reimbursement requests, and administrators who activate users and remove them from the system.<br>
<br>
After creating an account and being approved, standard employees will have the option to make a new request, view and manage their current pending requests, and view their request history, sorted by either date or amount and filtered by approval status.<br>
<br>
Finance managers may approve or deny requests made by standard employees. They may also view all the requests they have reviewed.
